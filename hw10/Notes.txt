-a compiler generates code that will be running later, and thus a linkage is necessary

- Compile - producing code in which when executed will evaluated the expression
- We've also talked of self-evaluating compile, compile quoted, and the other compile example.
- Last we talked about compile sequence, and we talked about expressions in which you have to have labels.
- Such as if expression, where you compile the test and you either go 1 or the other. check label-generator in page 3
- If you have questions on regarding it, send him an email.

- We also talked about lambda expression, and the thing about an lambda expression is that we don't normally write it on itself
- 

- Example 5

(lambda (x y) (+ x y))


It puts the last in first, and first 

Nothing in page 4 do you need to modify
